Hi [Manager Name],

I would like to propose an initiative to strengthen our release governance, traceability, and audit readiness by leveraging our existing Atlassian ecosystem (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence) along with Rovo AI capabilities.

Current Challenge  
Today, key release evidence is fragmented across Jira acceptance criteria, pull requests, comments, and manual documentation. This creates audit risk, slows release approvals, and makes it difficult to ensure all requirements are fully validated before production.

Proposed Solution  
Introduce an AI-driven automation that generates a “Feature Evidence Pack” for each feature.  
This automation would:

• Collect all stories under a feature  
• Extract acceptance criteria, comments, and status  
• Link pull requests and merge outcomes  
• Detect conflicts such as missing acceptance criteria, open PRs, or blocker comments  
• Publish an audit-ready Confluence document automatically  

Business Impact  

• Improves audit and compliance traceability  
• Prevents incomplete or risky releases  
• Eliminates manual release documentation effort  
• Standardizes governance across teams  

Future Enhancement Opportunity  

We can extend this into an AI-based Release Readiness Dashboard that provides leadership with a real-time go/no-go score based on acceptance criteria coverage, PR status, risks, and defects.  
This would enable more data-driven and confident production release decisions.

I believe this initiative can be delivered incrementally, starting with a quick-win automation in a few weeks and evolving into a broader AI-assisted release governance capability.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this idea and explore whether we can pilot it within one product area.

Thank you,  
[Your Nam
