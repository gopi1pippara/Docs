    \ trace). What is the root cause and the suggested line for a fix?\n17. I'm getting\
    \ a 403 Forbidden error on the /admin endpoint. Analyze the security configuration\
    \ and suggest why my user is being denied access.\n18. Highlight a block of code:\
    \ /fix this code to prevent a potential 'ConcurrentModificationException'.\n19.\

    \ class, including mocks for the Repository dependency.\n23. Write an integration\
    \ test using @SpringBootTest for the POST /api/v1/orders endpoint that verifies\
    \ a 201 response.\n\n# --- DESIGN PATTERNS, CACHING, & PERFORMANCE ---\n\n## DESIGN\
    \ PATTERNS\n# Best Practice: Highlight the file or class you suspect uses a pattern.\n\
    24. Which Gang of Four (GoF) design pattern is implemented in this 'NotificationServiceFactory'\
    \ class, and how does it promote loose coupling?\n25. Refactor the selected utility\
    \ class using the Builder Pattern to improve object creation readability.\n26.\
