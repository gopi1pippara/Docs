- Help debug a 500 error occurring in this REST endpoint during POST requests.

# 5. Services, Business Logic, and Data Layer
- Explain the purpose of this service class and how it connects to repositories.
- Describe the data flow from controller to repository for this operation.
- Identify common performance bottlenecks in this service layer.
- Suggest improvements for transaction management using @Transactional.
- Explain the difference between the interface and its implementation class here.

# 6. Repository and Database Layer
- List all database entities and relationships in this project.
