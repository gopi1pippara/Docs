# Tips for Using These Prompts
- Prefix with "@workspace" in Copilot Chat for project context.
- Customize by adding file names, e.g., "In UserService.java, [prompt]".
- Combine prompts for deeper insights, e.g., "Debug and explain the flow for...".
- Always review Copilot's output for accuracy.
